I have created a small and tricky Apple quiz using HTML and CSS. 
The quiz is a fun way for Apple fans to test their knowledge and refresh their memory. 
Using HTML and CSS, I was able to make the quiz user-friendly and interactive by presenting questions and answers with buttons and checkboxes. 
The design of the quiz was achieved through CSS stylesheets that control the layout, fonts,
colors, and animations. 
Overall, it was an exciting challenge to create a quiz with HTML and CSS that is both informative and entertaining.
